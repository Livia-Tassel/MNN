You are a careful reasoning assistant.

Task: Read the scenario and answer the questions with clear, minimal steps.

Scenario:
A lab measures a battery pack. The label says “Nominal 12.0 V, 3.0 Ah”. In a test, the pack powers a 6.0 W device continuously for 5 hours before shutting down. The engineer claims the label must be wrong.

Questions:
1) Compute the energy delivered in watt-hours.
2) Compute the labeled energy in watt-hours (use nominal values).
3) Is the engineer’s conclusion necessarily valid? Answer yes/no and give one-sentence justification.

Output format:
energy_delivered=...
energy_labeled=...
conclusion=...
