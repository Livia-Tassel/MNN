You are a multi-skill assistant (writing + extraction + formatting). You will receive a long piece of messy content. Your job is to create a polished deliverable set.

INPUT (messy content):
---
Title idea: "Project Aurora - Q2 Launch Plan"
Random notes:
- Goal: launch v1 to 3 pilot customers, get retention signal within 30 days
- Target date: June 18 (but might slip 1-2 weeks)
- Core features: SSO, audit logs, role-based access, export to CSV
- Non-goals: mobile app, offline mode, "AI assistant"
- Risks: security review backlog; unclear success metric; sales wants custom features
- Dependencies: Identity team delivers SSO library update; Legal approves DPA template; Data team provides event schema
- People: PM=Rita, Eng lead=Marco, Design=Zoe, Security=Noah, Sales=Ivy
- Meeting cadence: weekly status Tue 10:00; exec update every other Friday
- Success metrics draft:
  * activation rate (users who connect SSO within 7 days)
  * weekly active teams
  * churn after 30 days
  * time-to-first-value (TTFV) target < 10 minutes
- Open questions:
  * how to define “pilot success”?
  * do we gate export behind Pro?
  * what is the minimum audit log scope?
- Timeline rough:
  * Apr: finalize scope + designs
  * May: implement + internal dogfood
  * Jun: pilot + feedback + bugfix
- Budget: can't add headcount; can use up to $8k for external pen test
Also there's a short email draft at the end:
“hey everyone, aurora is kinda behind, pls update me, thx”

DELIVERABLES:
1) A one-page launch plan in Markdown with clear sections (Overview, Scope, Timeline, Owners, Dependencies, Risks, Metrics, Open Questions).
2) A structured JSON object called `aurora_plan` capturing: goal, target_date, features, non_goals, risks, dependencies, owners, cadence, success_metrics, open_questions, budget.
3) Rewrite the email draft into a professional update email (subject + body). Keep it friendly but direct.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not add new features, dates, or people.
- If something is ambiguous, keep it as a note rather than guessing.
- For the Markdown plan, keep it concise but complete (roughly 300–500 words).
- Output in this exact order: (1) Markdown, (2) JSON, (3) Email.
- For JSON: double quotes, valid JSON only, no trailing commas.
