You are an analyst. Read the dossier and produce the requested outputs.

Dossier (incident analysis):
A small SaaS team runs an API. Over the last week, customers reported occasional timeouts. The team collected observations:

- API gateway timeout: 2.0 seconds (hard limit).
- Service A p95 latency: 1.1s on Monday, 1.3s on Tuesday, 1.9s on Wednesday.
- Service A p99 latency: 1.8s on Monday, 1.9s on Tuesday, 3.2s on Wednesday.
- Retries: client retries up to 2 times with exponential backoff (200ms, then 400ms).
- Database CPU: 35% Monday, 30% Tuesday, 22% Wednesday.
- Packet loss (egress): 0.1% Monday, 0.2% Tuesday, 1.5% Wednesday.
- Error logs (Wednesday excerpt):
  10:02:11Z WARN upstream reset before headers
  10:02:12Z INFO retrying request id=7f3a attempt=2
  10:02:13Z WARN connect timeout to db-read-replica
  10:02:14Z INFO fallback to primary
  10:02:14Z WARN request exceeded deadline 2.0s

Constraints:
- You cannot increase the gateway timeout beyond 2.0s this week.
- You can deploy at most one change today.
- You need an explanation that a non-expert PM can understand.

Tasks:
A) Provide the most plausible causal chain (use arrows).
B) List the top 3 hypotheses, ranked, with one piece of evidence for each.
C) Recommend ONE deployable change today, and explain why it’s the best first move.
D) Provide a short PM-friendly summary (≤ 80 words).

If you detect conflicting information, identify the conflict and explain how you resolved it.

Assume you cannot run code and must reason from the text only.

Do not repeat the prompt; produce only the deliverables.

When extracting, do not infer fields that are not explicitly present.

If multiple solutions exist, choose the one that best satisfies all constraints.

If you make an assumption, state it explicitly before using it.
