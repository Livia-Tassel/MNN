You are a senior operations + product analyst. You will receive a mixed dossier (notes, logs, a table, and email snippets). Your job is to reason carefully, detect inconsistencies, and produce a structured decision.

STRICT RULES:
- Do not invent facts not supported by the dossier.
- If information conflicts, explicitly flag the conflict and pick the most defensible interpretation.
- Follow the output schema exactly (JSON), with double quotes and no trailing commas.

DOSSIER (Case #01):

1) Background (from kickoff doc)
We run “Orchid”, a multi-tenant inference service. Customers send requests to /v1/generate.
Key service objectives (SLOs):
- Availability: 99.9% monthly.
- Latency: p95 < 800 ms for requests under 2k tokens.
- Cost: average GPU-seconds per request must not increase by more than 5% month-over-month.

Known architecture:
Client → Edge → Router → Model-Server → KVCache store → GPU workers → Response
The Router uses a queue. If the queue depth is high, it sheds low-priority traffic.

2) Change timeline (from change log)
- Feb 10: Enabled “speculative decoding” for 10% of traffic (feature flag: SPEC_DEC).
- Feb 12: Increased max_batch_size from 16 to 32 on GPU workers.
- Feb 13: Introduced a new retry policy at Edge: up to 1 retry when upstream returns 503 (backoff 150 ms).
- Feb 14: Rolled out new KVCache compression mode “MNN-lite” to 30% of traffic.
- Feb 15: Config change: Router queue_shed_threshold reduced from 240 to 180.

Feb 14      160     235     910     1700     1.2%     0.9%      81%       64%
Feb 15      165     250     980     1900     1.5%     1.8%      79%       63%
Feb 16      162     245     930     1750     1.3%     1.6%      78%       63%

Notes:
- “Shed_rate” is Router’s fraction of requests that were rejected due to queue depth.
- “KV_hit_rate” is the fraction of tokens served from KVCache (higher is better for speed).

6) Email snippets
Email A (from PM, Feb 16):
“Customers are complaining about ‘random failures’. They say it got worse after the KVCache compression rollout. Can we roll it back today?”

Email B (from infra engineer, Feb 16):
“I suspect the Router’s new shed threshold is too aggressive. Also, I saw GPU utilization drop slightly on Feb 15 even though traffic rose.”

Email C (from finance, Feb 16):
“Reminder: cost is tight. Any fix that materially increases GPU-seconds/request needs justification and approval.”

7) Constraints and goals (today)
- You can do at most ONE of: rollback one change, or adjust one config, or ship one code patch.
- You must propose a plan that improves p95 latency AND reduces customer-visible failures (5xx + shedding) within 24 hours.
- You must not increase GPU utilization by more than 3 percentage points on average.
